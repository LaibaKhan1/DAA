üìå # Bellman-Ford Algorithm Simulation
üõ†Ô∏è ## Setup Instructions

    Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

    Install the required Python libraries using pip:

    pip install matplotlib networkx ipywidgets

    Open the project notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Execute the Simulation

    Run all cells sequentially in the notebook.

    Provide the following inputs via interactive widgets:

        Number of vertices

        Number of edges

        Source node

        Each edge in the format: (Start Node, End Node, Weight)

    Click the Run Algorithm button to visualize the shortest paths.

    Output:

        Final shortest distances

        Visualization of the graph with labeled weights and node distances

        Error messages (if any) in case of negative weight cycles
